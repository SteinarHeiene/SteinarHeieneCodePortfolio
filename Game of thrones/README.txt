Back when I in spite of season 7 had hopes for season 8 of Game of Thrones, I
made a bet with my friends of how it would all end. We all guessed who would
die and then points would be distributed based on how many each player got
right. As part of my obsession with this, I made a program that would roughly
find each players chance of winning. The program uses a brute-force approach,
and would run for multiple hours straight. Attached is the source code, an
example readfile, and a mid-season result chart.

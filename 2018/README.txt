I learned many things during my college years in Hamar, but good routines in
saving work for posterity was not one of them. As a result, very little of
my work from before 2018 died with my school hard drive. I was however able
to salvage a video portfolio featuring some of my larger projects. The first
1:38 of the video features different concepts demonstrated in a 3D
physics engine built by myself (with supervision) as part of a larger
assignment.

The other half of the video features projects made in the game making tool
Unity. Unity uses C# as a scripting language, and this is where most of my
work was done.

Uploaded video was too large to upload, will look into github LFS and get back
to this.
